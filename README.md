# Traveler

This is the front end for my other project, 'TravelerAPI'.

## Development server

Run `ng serve` for a dev server. The app will automatically reload if you change any of the source files.

## Status

This project is not currently under development, but if development would be continued some of the items on the to do list would be:

* Ability for users to sign in
* Ability to add attractions and destinations
* Watch lists for users to be able to bookmark places they want to visit
